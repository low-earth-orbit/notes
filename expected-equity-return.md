# Calculation of expected equity return

## Method based on PE

$$
\begin{aligned}
Expected \ equity \ return \ (nominal) &= 1 / PE + Earnings \ growth \ rate \\
 &= 1 / PE + Nominal \ GDP \ growth \ rate \\
 &= 1 / CAPE + Potential \ GDP \ growth \ rate + Expected \ inflation \\
\end{aligned}
$$

For example, CAPE (a.k.a. Shiller PE) is `25`, potential GDP growth rate is `1.5%`, inflation expectation is `2.2%`, therefore, expected equity return is `1/25 + 1.5% + 2.2% = 7.7%`.

If the risk-free rate is `2.5%` (overnight lending rate / short-term treasury bills), the equity risk premium (ERP) is `7.7% - 2.5% = 5.2%`.

$$
\begin{aligned}
ERP &= Expected \ equity \ return - Risk \ free \ rate
\end{aligned}
$$

As the expected inflation is `2.2%`, the real expected return of equity is `7.7% - 2.2% = 5.5%`.

$$
\begin{aligned}
Expected \ equity \ return \ (real) &= Expected \ equity \ return \ (nominal) - Expected \ inflation \\
\end{aligned}
$$
