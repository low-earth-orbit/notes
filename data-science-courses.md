# Data Science Open Courses

A curriculum for DA/DS/MLE/DE.

- DA: Data analyst
- DS: Data scientist
- MLE: Machine learning engineer
- DE: Data Engineer

## Roadmap

- AI roadmap: <https://i.am.ai/roadmap>
- AI and Data Scientist Roadmap: <https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist>

## Required background

### Math and stats

- Calculus (for DS/MLE)
- Discrete Math (for DS/MLE/DE)
- Linear Algebra (for DS/MLE)
- Probability and Statistics (for DA/DS/MLE/DE)

### Programming

- Python

  - [HarvardX: CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python)

- SQL

  - [The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/)

- Data structures and algorithms (not required for DA)
  - [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

### Tools

- Git
- Command-line environment
- Visual Studio Code

## Data Science

Take both:

- [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

  - _This is the milestone for DA... For DA, you probably need Excel, Tableau, SAS, Power BI etc. in addition to Python..._

- [HarvardX: Introduction to Data Science with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-science/harvard-university-introduction-to-data-science-with-python): Covers the statistics side of data science.

Book for reference: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) (preferably the Python version)

_This is the milestone for DS... Now there are two choices: Data Engineering or MLE. You can, of course, do both. MLE is harder. Sometimes positions prefer those who have graduate degrees. Resources listed here might not be enough. I suggest DE then dive deeper to ML if you're interested..._

## Data Engineering

- [IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer): ETL, data pipelines & databases

## Cloud Data Engineering

Learn AWS and get these two certificates:

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
- AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate

_This is the milestone for DE. If you're interested, you can dive deep to ML/DL/AI.._

## Introduction to AI

[CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python)

## ML

[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

## Deep Learning

[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

## NLP

[Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)

## MLOps

[Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)

_This is the milestone for MLE..._
