## Private Equity

There appears to be a private equity premium from historical data. This premium is commonly attributed to illiquidity. However, the question for individual investors is whether or not the anticipated premium outweighs the associated risks and fees.

## Home Country Bias

Allocating 30% of the equity portion to Canadian stocks showed the minimum volatility. This can be considered as the optimal home country bias for Canadian investors. For bonds, that is 60% to Canadian; however, the benefit of fixed-income diversification might not be worth the added complexity (& MER, foreign taxes, currency hedging cost, etc) by international bonds.
