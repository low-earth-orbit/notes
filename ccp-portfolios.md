# Example Canadian Couch Potato Portfolios

The following are examples.

## Bonds

ZAG

## Stocks

### One Fund Solution

Choose from VEQT or XEQT. I prefer 30% to Canadian equities. XEQT has lower MER.

### 2-Fund Solution

```mermaid

"XIC" : 30
"XAW" : 70
```

### 3-Fund Solution

This 3-Fund Solution does not include emerging markets equities - however, I think it's okay.

```mermaid

"XIC" : 30
"XUU" : 45
"XEF" : 25
