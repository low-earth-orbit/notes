# Web Development Starter Guide

To begin with, read the [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) to get an idea of what techs fall into the umbrella of web development.

## [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/)

This is the best open comprehensive intro course to web dev on the internet as of now. Do not expect much depth but it covers up-to-date techs that companies actually use, including React, Node, Express, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native (for mobile dev), CI/CD, docker and databases. If you don't have basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, do a crash course on them.

Prerequisites:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Optional:

- Bootstrap: This is a popular CSS library. Larger organizations have their own frameworks team so they don't use Bootstrap.
- DOM
- Web API
- jQuery

Alternatives:

- The Odin Project: Choose the Full Stack JavaScript path; who uses Ruby on Rails!
- Angela Yu's web dev course on Udemy
- freeCodeCamp: More nuanced

## [React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

The best React course. React is the most popular FE framework. This course includes Redux, React Router and Next.js as well.

Only buy Udemy courses when they're on sale.

Alternatives:

- Some companies use other frameworks such as Angular and Vue.

## [NodeJS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)

The best NodeJS course, taught by the same instructor as the React course above. For modern web app BE, the tech stack consists of Node, Express, GraphQL, REST API, NoSQL DB (e.g. MongoDB), SQL DB (e.g. Postgres).

Optional:

- Java and Oracle: Many companies (still) use Java and Oracle database.
- Some companies use Python for BE

## Git & CLI

[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is a good place. It may cover a wider range of topics than you need. Git and CLI are the musts.

## Agile

If you haven't worked in an Agile team, it is good to know the basics of Agile. Watching a few videos on Agile is enough. The [Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified) certification is nice-to-have if you want to become a PM - two-day training and easy exam; for other roles, the certification doesn't carry much value.

Alternatives:

- [CAPM / PMP by PMI](https://www.pmi.org/certifications)

## AWS

If you want to work as a Cloud Engineer, DevOp or {MLE/DE that leverages cloud infrastructure}, get an **associate**-level certificate; for other roles, it is nice-to-have but not necessary. AWS has a doc on [certification path](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). For most people, I recommend this path:

1. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, then
2. AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, then
3. AWS Certified Developer - Associate

I don't recommend skipping CCP, unless you already are familiar with cloud infrastructure. The pro-level and specialty level certs are a lot harder and may not be worthy (the time) to attempt.

Alternatives:

- AWS is the most popular public cloud, Azure the second, followed then by Google.

## Leet

I recommend starting with a curated list of questions - [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). There is a decreasing marginal return per the number of problems solved. If you don't know the theory, take algorithm courses that covers relevant topics.

Optional:

- Data structures and algorithms courses
- [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/)

## Books

Good books to read for leisure:

- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://www.amazon.ca/Software-Engineers-Guidebook-Navigating-positions/dp/908338182X)
- [Behavioral interviews for Software Engineers](https://www.amazon.ca/Behavioral-Interviews-Software-Engineers-Strategies/dp/B0C1JFQYCR/)
- [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide/dp/1736049119/)
- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM)
