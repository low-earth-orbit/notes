# Web Development Starter Guide

This guide is created in offer useful information to those who are interested in pursuing a career in full-stack web development, whether they are computer science students or come from a non-CS background.

If you're a computer science student, the ideal time to start following this guide is right after having a foundation in programming, typically completing first year of study.

If you come from a non-CS background, this guide requires a basic understanding of computer science, such as completing [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).

## Foundation

To begin, read the [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) to get an idea of the technologies that fall under the umbrella of web development.

[fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/) is the best comprehensive introductory course to web development available on the internet. Do not expect much depth but it covers up-to-date technologies that companies actually use.

If you prefer video-based learning, I recommend Angela Yu's course, linked below.

**Buy Udemy courses only when they're on sale.**

###### Alternatives:

- [Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy

## React

React is the most popular front-end framework. [This](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) is the best React course available.

###### Alternatives:

- Some companies use other frameworks such as Angular and Vue.

## NodeJS

[This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/), taught by the same instructor as the React course above, is the best resource for learning NodeJS.

###### Optional:

- Some companies use Java, Python, Ruby for back-end development.

## Tools: Git & CLI

[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is a good place. It may cover a wider range of topics than you need. Git and CLI are the musts.

## Agile Methodologies

If you haven't worked in an Agile team, it is good to know the basics of Agile. Watching a few videos on Agile / a Software Engineering course that covers Agile should be enough.

The [Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified) certification is nice-to-have if you want to become a PM - two-day training and easy exam; for other roles, the certification doesn't carry much value / don't waste your money.

## Cloud: AWS

If you want to work as a Cloud Engineer, DevOp or Cloud MLE/DE, get an **associate**-level certificate; for other roles, it is nice-to-have but not necessary. AWS has a doc on [certification path](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). For most people, I recommend the Application Architect path.

I don't recommend skipping CCP, unless you already are familiar with cloud infrastructure. The pro-level and specialty level certs are a lot harder and may not be worthy to attempt in terms of time efficiency.

###### Prerequisites:

- Computer Networking, or preferably Cloud Computing
- Software Architecture/Design Patterns

###### Alternatives:

- AWS is the most popular public cloud, Azure the second, followed then by GCP.

## Leetcode

I recommend starting with a curated list of questions - [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). There is a decreasing marginal return per the number of problems solved. If you don't know the theory, take algorithm courses that cover relevant topics.

###### Prerequisites:

- Data structures and algorithms

###### Optional:

- [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/) (book)

## Books

Recommended books to read for leisure:

- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://www.amazon.ca/Software-Engineers-Guidebook-Navigating-positions/dp/908338182X)
- [Behavioral interviews for Software Engineers](https://www.amazon.ca/Behavioral-Interviews-Software-Engineers-Strategies/dp/B0C1JFQYCR/)
- [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide/dp/1736049119/)
- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM)

## Additional Resources

- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) covers the core courses in a typical Bachelor's degree program.

- [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) references resource on more topics.

- If you're unsure about which resource is better for a topic, check on Reddit.
