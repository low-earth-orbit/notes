# Web Development Starter Guide

This is a study guide to those interested in pursuing a career in full-stack web development, whether they are computer science students or come from a non-CS background.

If you're a computer science student, the ideal time to start following this guide is right after having a foundation in programming, typically after completing your first semester of study.

If you come from a non-CS background, this guide requires a basic understanding of computer science, such as completing CS50x ([course material](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) without registering on edX).

## Foundation

To begin, read the [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) to get an idea of the technologies that fall under the umbrella of web development.

I recommend [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) as the comprehensive introductory course to web development.

If you prefer video-based learning, you might consider [Angela Yu's course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). However, it lacks coverage of CI/CD and containers. Moreover, I recommend skipping the blockchain app sections entirely as this particular topic isn't very useful.

**Buy Udemy courses only when they're on sale.**

## Frontend / React

React is the most popular front-end framework. I recommend [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Some companies use other frameworks. However, I do not recommend frontend frameworks other than React.

## Backend / Node.js

[This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/), taught by the same instructor as the React course above, is a good resource for learning Node/Express.

_Alternatives:_

- Some companies use `Java Spring Boot`, `C# .NET Core`, `Python Django/Flask/FastAPI`, `Ruby on Rails`, `PHP Laravel` for back-end development.
- I'd recommend `Java Spring Boot` as the close second to `Node.js`.

## Tools

Required:

- Git
- Command line basics
- Visual Studio Code

Additionally, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the following:

- React component library (e.g. [MUI](https://mui.com/))
- API client ([Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/), open source alternative to Postman)
- [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## Agile

If you haven't worked in an Agile team, it is good to know the basics of Agile. An introductory course on Agile or a Software Engineering course that includes Agile should suffice.

The [Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified) certification is nice-to-have if you want to become a Project Manager - two-day training and easy exam; Alternatively, consider the [PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications) by PMI if you're eligible. For other roles, these certifications don't carry much value.

## Cloud: AWS

If you want to work in infrastructure or DevOps, get an **associate-level** certificate; For other roles, it is nice-to-have but not necessary. AWS has a doc on [certification path](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). For most people following this guide, I recommend the Application Architect path. Resources I recommend are Stephane Maarek's courses and Tutorials Dojo (Jon Bonso)'s practice exams.

I don't recommend skipping Certified Cloud Practitioner, unless you are already familiar with cloud infrastructure. The pro-level and specialty-level certs are a lot harder and may not be worth attempting in terms of time efficiency.

_Prerequisites:_

- Computer Networks
- Software Architecture and Design

_Alternatives:_

- AWS is the most popular public cloud, followed by Azure and GCP.

## Leetcode

I recommend starting with a curated list of questions - [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). There is a decreasing marginal return with the number of problems solved. If you don't know the theory, take algorithm courses that cover relevant topics.

_Prerequisite:_

- Data structures and algorithms

## Books

Recommended books to read for leisure:

- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM)
- System Design Interview [Volume 1](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF) [Volume 2](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide/dp/1736049119/)
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.ca/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/)
  - Companion course: MIT 6.824
- [Behavioral interviews for Software Engineers](https://www.amazon.ca/Behavioral-Interviews-Software-Engineers-Strategies/dp/B0C1JFQYCR/)

## Missing Theory

- After reflecting on what I learned during my CS degree, I recommend the following topics for non-CS background people to fill in core theory:

  - Programming
    - UC Berkeley CS61A (Python) _or_
    - Harvard CS50P (Python) _or_
    - MIT 6.092 (Java)
  - Data structures and algorithms
    - UC Berkeley CS61B & UC Berkeley CS170
  - Databases
    - UC Berkeley CS186
  - Software engineering
    - UC Berkeley CS169

- Optional:

  - Math for CS (Recommended before studying algorithms)
    - MIT 6.042J
  - Computer networks
    - Stanford CS144
  - Computer architecture
    - UC Berkeley CS61C

- Additional resources:

  - [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) covers the core courses in a typical Bachelor's degree program.

  - [CS DIY](https://csdiy.wiki/en/) & [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) contain references to more topics. It can be used for cherry-picking.
