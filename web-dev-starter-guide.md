# Web Development Starter Guide

To begin, read the [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) to get an idea of the technologies that fall under the umbrella of web development.

## [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/)

This is the best comprehensive introductory course to web development available on the internet. Do not expect much depth but it covers up-to-date technologies that companies actually use. These include React, Node, Express, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native (for mobile development), CI/CD, Docker, and databases. If youâ€™re not familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, consider doing a crash course on those topics.

Prerequisites:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Optional:

- Bootstrap: A popular CSS library. Note that larger organizations often have their own frameworks and may not use Bootstrap.
- DOM
- Web API
- jQuery

Alternatives:

- The Odin Project: Choose the Full Stack JavaScript path; who uses Ruby on Rails!
- Angela Yu's web dev course on Udemy
- freeCodeCamp: More nuanced

## [React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

This is the best React course available. React is the most popular front-end framework. The course also covers Redux, React Router, and Next.js.

Buy Udemy courses only when they're on sale.

Alternatives:

- Some companies use other frameworks such as Angular and Vue.

## [NodeJS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)

This course, taught by the same instructor as the React course above, is the best resource for learning NodeJS. For modern back-end web applications, the tech stack typically includes Node, Express, GraphQL, REST APIs, NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), and SQL databases (e.g., Postgres).

Optional:

- Java and Oracle: Many companies (still) use Java and Oracle database.
- Some companies use Python for back-end development.

## Git & CLI

[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is a good place. It may cover a wider range of topics than you need. Git and CLI are the musts.

## Agile

If you haven't worked in an Agile team, it is good to know the basics of Agile. Watching a few videos on Agile is enough. The [Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified) certification is nice-to-have if you want to become a PM - two-day training and easy exam; for other roles, the certification doesn't carry much value.

Alternatives:

- [CAPM / PMP by PMI](https://www.pmi.org/certifications)

## AWS

If you want to work as a Cloud Engineer, DevOp or {MLE/DE that leverages cloud infrastructure}, get an **associate**-level certificate; for other roles, it is nice-to-have but not necessary. AWS has a doc on [certification path](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). For most people, I recommend this path:

1. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, then
2. AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, then
3. AWS Certified Developer - Associate

I don't recommend skipping CCP, unless you already are familiar with cloud infrastructure. The pro-level and specialty level certs are a lot harder and may not be worthy (the time) to attempt.

Alternatives:

- AWS is the most popular public cloud, Azure the second, followed then by Google.

## Leet

I recommend starting with a curated list of questions - [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). There is a decreasing marginal return per the number of problems solved. If you don't know the theory, take algorithm courses that cover relevant topics.

Optional:

- Data structures and algorithms courses
- [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/)

## Books

Good books to read for leisure:

- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://www.amazon.ca/Software-Engineers-Guidebook-Navigating-positions/dp/908338182X)
- [Behavioral interviews for Software Engineers](https://www.amazon.ca/Behavioral-Interviews-Software-Engineers-Strategies/dp/B0C1JFQYCR/)
- [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide/dp/1736049119/)
- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM)
