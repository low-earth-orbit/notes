# Web Development Starter Guide

This is a study guide to those interested in pursuing a career in full-stack web development, whether they are computer science students or come from a non-CS background.

If you're a computer science student, the ideal time to start following this guide is right after having a foundation in programming, typically after completing your first semester of study.

If you come from a non-CS background, this guide requires a basic understanding of computer science, such as completing [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).

## Foundation

To begin, read the [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) to get an idea of the technologies that fall under the umbrella of web development.

[Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) is the best comprehensive introductory course to web development available on the Internet.

If you prefer video-based learning, you might consider Angela Yu’s course on Udemy, linked below. However, it is **less preferred** as it lacks coverage of CI/CD and containers. Moreover, I recommend skipping the blockchain app sections entirely. While Angela includes trending concepts to make the course more appealing, this particular topic isn’t very useful.

**Buy Udemy courses only when they're on sale.**

_Alternative:_

- [Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)

## React

React is the most popular front-end framework. [This](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) is the best React course available.

_Alternatives:_

- Some companies use other frameworks such as Angular and Vue.js.

## NodeJS

[This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/), taught by the same instructor as the React course above, is the best resource for learning Node/Express.

_Optional:_

- Some companies use Java Spring, C# .NET, Python Flask/Django, Ruby on Rails for back-end development.

## Tools

[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is a good place. It may cover a wider range of topics than you need, but Git and CLI are musts.

Additionally, I recommend the following:

- React component library (e.g. MUI)
- OpenAPI Specification
- Semantic Versioning
- Figma

## Agile

If you haven't worked in an Agile team, it is good to know the basics of Agile. An introductory course on Agile or a Software Engineering course that includes Agile should suffice.

The [Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified) certification is nice-to-have if you want to become a Project Manager - two-day training and easy exam; Alternatively, consider the [PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications) by PMI if you're eligible. For other roles, these certification don't carry much value.

## Cloud: AWS

If you want to work as a Cloud Engineer or DevOps, get an **associate-level** certificate; For other roles, it is nice-to-have but not necessary. AWS has a doc on [certification path](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). For most people following this guide, I recommend the Application Architect path. Resources I recommend are Stephane Maarek's courses and Tutorials Dojo (Jon Bonso)'s practice exams.

I don't recommend skipping CCP, unless you are already familiar with cloud infrastructure. The pro-level and specialty level certs are a lot harder and may not be worth attempting in terms of time efficiency.

_Prerequisites:_

- Computer Networks
- Software Architecture and Design

_Alternatives:_

- AWS is the most popular public cloud, followed by Azure and GCP.

## Leetcode

I recommend starting with a curated list of questions - [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). There is a decreasing marginal return with the number of problems solved. If you don't know the theory, take algorithm courses that cover relevant topics.

_Prerequisites:_

- Data structures and algorithms

## Books

Recommended books to read for leisure:

- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM)
- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://www.amazon.ca/Software-Engineers-Guidebook-Navigating-positions/dp/908338182X)
- System Design Interview [Volume 1](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF) [Volume 2](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide/dp/1736049119/)
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.ca/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/)
- [Behavioral interviews for Software Engineers](https://www.amazon.ca/Behavioral-Interviews-Software-Engineers-Strategies/dp/B0C1JFQYCR/)

## Missing Theory for Non-CS People

- After reflecting on what I learned during my CS degree, I recommend the following topics for non-CS background people to fill in any missing theory:

  - Programming (Java or Python)
  - Databases
  - Discrete structures / Math for CS
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - Software engineering, including
    - Software architecture and design
    - Software development processes
  - Computer networks

- Useful resources:

  - [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) covers the core courses in a typical Bachelor's degree program.

  - [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) contains references to more topics. It can be used for cherry-picking.

  - If you're unsure about which resource is better for a particular topic, check on Reddit.
