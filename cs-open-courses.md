# List of Computer Science Open Courses

Open courses on interesting topics. This is an evolving DRAFT plan intended for enriching understandings of certain topics that I missed in my BCS degree or did not learn well.

## Software Engineering

I think I miss a bit software architecture and design.

[Software Design and Architecture Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/software-design-architecture) (1 month at 10 hours a week)

## Data Science

[Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) (6 months at 10 hours a week)

- More coverage than CS2545

[HarvardX: Introduction to Data Science with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-science/harvard-university-introduction-to-data-science-with-python) (8 weeks, 3â€“4 hours per week)

- Seems to focus on stats, i.e. regression

## ML

[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) (2 months at 10 hours a week)

- I read [this book](https://www.statlearning.com/) years ago...
- Learning algorithms

## AI

[AI For Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone) (6 hours to complete)

[CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python) (7 weeks long, 10 - 30 hours per week)

- More algorithms, including ML algorithms
- Covers NLP as well

## UX design

- Good to know if I work on front end

## Modern Java

Spring boot

## HCI

## NLP

Not interested in the subject matter but hot. Should I skip?

## Data Mining

Not interested in the subject matter. Should I skip?

## Big Data

- Why so many data areas!
- Covered by others?

## Game theory

It's interesting. Worth to revisit?

## Operations research

- Is it good to take a course?

- Overlaps with numerical analysis CS3113?

## CFA

I am an "old" fella. What can I do with CFA? To sell mutual funds that I would never buy?
